# k≈ìri tests

A collection of JUnit 5 tests for the two hypothetical classes `IP` and `Network`.

If you too share a great interest in forests of IPv4 addresses, you may use these tests by creating the required
classes, namely `src/main/java/edu/kit/informatik/(IP|Network|ParseException).java`.

Please contribute your own test cases by adding a new test class or adjusting an existing one and submitting the changes
as a merge request.
